Recommendation engine is a very popular area of interest on how does the content which we love is delivered to us, so this project explains about the tools and techniques used by the industries which helps them top recommend the stuff which we love to increase their viewership. The main objective of the project is to recommend the movies for the user, the tools which we have used in here are Sklearn, NLTK (natural language tool kit) and pandasâ€™ functionality to manipulate and extract information from the dataset, finally we have used stream lit as a web framework to integrate the code with a small stream lit application, which allows you to get your hands on an actual website where you get the recommendation for your desired movies.
